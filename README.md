This introduction, and this Kata is taken from [emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) and this Kata was originally created by [Terry Hughes](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose)

This is a great Kata to use if you wish to experiment with different ways of testing legacy code.

## Getting Set Up

```pipenv install```

## Running the Tests

``` pipenv run pytest --cov-report html:cov_html --cov=gilded_rose --approvaltests-use-reporter='PythonNative' ```

## Your Challenge

1. Run the tests
1. Open coverage file ```cov_html/index.html```
1. Modify the return_fixture in test_approval.py until you get 100% code coverage

## Your Challenge (continued)

1. Refactor the code!
